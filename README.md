# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT ESP/HSSP 2024
Welcome to How to CAD Almost Anything! In this repository, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Fusion 360 files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a mug, a bottle of Diet Coke, or a Saturn V rocket? What about designing the blades of a jet-engine? A test dummy? In this workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 5 1.5-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new Fusion 360 skills, while the second half will see the application of these new skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, and more about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

Through the workshop’s 5 sessions, the goal is for the student to:
* Have learned all the essential Fusion 360 skills.
* Have built a comprehensive design portfolio, in the form of a presentation (see Workshop Portfolio (optional) section below), to showcase all the different in-class projects and Fusion 360 skills mastered.
* Feel that it can take any object and exclaim, “I know how to CAD this!”.

### Session 1: Introduction to Fusion 360!
(Saturday, March 2)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll get ourselves acquainted with the Fusion 360 workspace, and start learning some of the most used tools. Session 1's goals include:
* Creating sketches (using basic shapes, construction lines, smart-dimensioning, sketch relationships) and understanding planes.
* Understanding what it means for a sketch to be fully defined.
* Locating and using the different elementary feature commands (boss extrude, boss cut, fillet, chamfer).
* Editing sketches and features after creating them.
* Coloring parts and changing material properties.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 1, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A cake
*	A pencil (using an engineering drawing)

**To do (optional):** Create a presentation (Powerpoint/Google Slides) and title it “Projects Portfolio”.  There, add 3 slides, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Solidworks skills employed to during the design process.

**Session Recordings:** To be posted.

**Session Slides:** To be posted.

### Session 5: Living in a world made from plastic bricks!
(Saturday, April 6)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll move towards one of the most powerful features within Solidworks/Fusion 360, which is that of making assemblies and engineering drawings! Session 5's goals include:
* Learning how to make an assembly of multiple parts.
* Learning (time-permitting) how to make an exploded view of an assembly and subsequentially animating it.
* Learning how to create an engineering drawing of a part.
* Exploring the best-practices of drawing creation, including different formats and information to be conveyed (such as tolerancing, material properties).

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 5, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
A [20x20 LEGO base plate](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/1a/00/7d/4c/98/6772da62fb1c7aa8d36c046b39b84e32_preview_featured.jpg).
