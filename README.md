# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT ESP/HSSP 2024
Welcome to How to CAD Almost Anything! Fusion 360 edition. In this repository, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Fusion 360 files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a mug, a bottle of Diet Coke, or a Saturn V rocket? What about designing the blades of a jet-engine? A test dummy? In this workshop MIT ESP workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 5 1.5-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new Fusion 360 skills, while the second half will see the application of these new skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, and more about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

Through the workshop’s 5 sessions, the goal is for the student to:
* Have learned all the essential Fusion 360 skills.
* Have built a comprehensive design portfolio, in the form of a presentation (see Workshop Portfolio (optional) section below), to showcase all the different in-class projects and Fusion 360 skills mastered.
* Feel that it can take almost any object and exclaim, “I know how to CAD this!”.

_This course is a sibling version of the original ["How to CAD Almost Anything"](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Almost-Anything) course, adapted into 5, 1.5-hour long sessions, to fit with the MIT ESP/HSSP schedule. While not as extensive as the Solidworks version, this course still provides a comprehensive introduction to Fusion 360, sufficient for students to be able to later navigate the CAD software independently!_

*	Learning how to use the lofting and sweep command.
*	Continuing to master previously explored tools, such as revolve, linear/circular patterns and plane creation.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 4, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A banana, in honor of the banana lounge (using various plane cuts, splines and lofts).
*	A snowman. 

**To do (optional):** Add 2 slides to the portfolio, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Fusion 360 skills employed to during the design process.

## Workshop Portfolio (Optional)

“How to CAD almost anything!” is a purely project-based workshop, with most, if not all the projects taking place as session activities. As a result, the workshop does not have any form of “homework”, other than additional work that the student is willing to put to expand on the in-class activities. However, as mentioned above, one of the purposes of this workshop is for the student to build a portfolio of projects, one which can be used to showcase its 3D-modeling skills. Hence, as an optional workshop activity, the student will be able to create a portfolio presentation, consisting of the slides made during/after each session. Although this is an ungraded activity, the student is encouraged to be creative and use this as an opportunity to showcase its learnings! Feel free to include screenshots from the Fusion 360 workspace, engineering drawings or anything deemed appropriate. Additionally, including one last slide with thoughts about the workshop and recommendations to make it even better next time would be greatly appreciated!
