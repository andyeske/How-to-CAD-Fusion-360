# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT ESP/HSSP 2024
Welcome to How to CAD Almost Anything! Fusion 360 edition. In this repository, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Autodesk Fusion 360 files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a LEGO house, a snowman, or a cubesat? What about designing jet-engine-like fidget spinner? A banana? In this MIT ESP workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 5 1.5-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) skills, while the second half will see the application of these new skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, and more about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

_This course is a sibling version of the original ["How to CAD Almost Anything"](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Almost-Anything) course, adapted into 5, 1.5-hour long sessions, to fit with the MIT ESP/HSSP schedule. While not as extensive as the Solidworks version, this course still provides a comprehensive introduction to Fusion 360, sufficient for students to be able to later navigate the CAD software independently!_

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll get ourselves acquainted with the Fusion 360 workspace, and start learning some of the most used tools. Session 1's goals include:
* Creating sketches (using basic shapes, construction lines, smart-dimensioning, sketch relationships) and understanding planes.
* Understanding what it means for a sketch to be fully defined.
* Locating and using the different elementary feature commands (boss extrude, boss cut, fillet, chamfer).
* Editing sketches and features after creating them.
* Coloring parts and changing material properties.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 1, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A cake.
*	A pencil (using an engineering drawing).

**To do (optional):** Create a presentation (Powerpoint/Google Slides) and title it “Projects Portfolio”.  There, add 3 slides, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Fusion 360 skills employed to during the design process.

**Session Recordings:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asp0r6rWSmQ.

**Session Slides:** Available at the [Session 1](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Fusion-360/tree/main/Session%20Files/Session%201) folder.

*	Learning how to use the lofting and sweep command.
*	Continuing to master previously explored tools, such as revolve, linear/circular patterns and plane creation.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 4, we’ll design a variety of items, including:

*	A snowman. 

**To do (optional):** Add 2 slides to the portfolio, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Fusion 360 skills employed to during the design process.

### Session 5: Living in a world made from plastic bricks!
(Saturday, April 6)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll move towards one of the most powerful features within Fusion 360, which is that of making assemblies and engineering drawings! Session 5's goals include:
* Learning how to make an assembly of multiple parts.
* Learning (time-permitting) how to make an exploded view of an assembly and subsequentially animating it.
* Learning how to create an engineering drawing of a part.
* Exploring the best-practices of drawing creation, including different formats and information to be conveyed (such as tolerancing, material properties).

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 5, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
* A [20x20 LEGO base plate](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/1a/00/7d/4c/98/6772da62fb1c7aa8d36c046b39b84e32_preview_featured.jpg).
